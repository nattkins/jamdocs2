## We've a thing about Forms

We love making them, because a well-made form, that is one that is UX aware; makes workflows much less energy sapping for users and developers alike.

Its a great place where tech and business can meet, its something that business 'gets' and a great deal of development is about user input. Also it represents a place where business users get to think about what makes sense for them, and what would make sense for some 'like' them. This is important, often requirements are written for someone not like 'me' - customers, employees, etc Its why we have personnas. But in the case of creating business forms, the best people to work with are the people who are likely to use that form. It means that user feedback is high quality and its easy to elicit.
