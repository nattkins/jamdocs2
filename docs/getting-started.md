## Our Approach

* We relish large engaging meetings (both remote and in-person) and we use liberating structures to do this
* Adoption and engagement are central to our practice - we want to help our clients do amazing things.
* We use a systemic approach that asks why problems are problems, before jumping and busily 'solving' them.
* We believe like TRIZ that there aren't unique problems, there are families of problems to which there are already solutions.
* We value curiosity when talking and listening and checking in with people, sometimes using - Clean Language because chances are - if we assume - we'll make an ass out of you and me.
* We're all about 'cleaning up the inputs'
* We have found an agile approach that leads with documentation and demonstration works best with clients of all sizes.
