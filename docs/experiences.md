## Working Remotely 

We've been doing it for a while - and didn't think it was such a big deal - we do a quick graphic to show who we have worked with remotely

## About Migrations

Migration might be any of these things:

1. A chance to ditch the old tech
2. A Mandate from 'on-high'
3. A corporate rebranding exercise
4. A cover for corporate reorganization
5. Part of a governmental reprioritization
6. An excuse
7. A chance to forget past mistakes/past trauma (you know that old project that went very very wrong, we don't know much but we're not doing _that_ again!
8. A do-over

It's clear to us that migration mainly goes wrong when the goals are vague or numerous - it would be a funny sort of game where you couldn't see the goals and there were lots of them! Maybe this point will seem obvious, because if you don't have a goal then by definition you can't win! But too often the planning is too much like a spy novel, with multiple stakeholders with multiple interests all in competition.

It is as a great woman once said: "its like asking X to tell Y to get Z to change!"

The other way to go wrong with migrations is to make any of these assumptions:

* Users won't change their way of working because 'people hate change'
* Users won't need teaching as the tools are all so user-friendly.
* Users will have to change as we're taking away the tools that they are used to.
* The platform we're using is very flexible, we can code our way out of any difficulties.
* Users will teach themselves, there is a whole internet out there of useful information

You can probably add your own here, so that's exactly what we do, our plan is quite simple

 1. Get a vision, it will be a metaphor for what you want to happen.
 2. Get widespread agreement of what will be seen and be heard differently if this vision is realized.
 3. Choose technology and people that are aligned in delivering this vision.
 4. Training / adoption
 5. Start
 6. Training / adoption
 7. Do more
 8. Training / adoption
 9. Reach milestone, celebrate and feel good
10. Goto step 1

## We've a thing about Forms

We love making them, because a well-made form, that is one that is UX aware; makes workflows much less energy sapping for users and developers alike.

It's a great place where tech and business can meet, its something that business 'gets' and a great deal of development is about user input. Also, it represents a place where business users get to think about what makes sense for them, and what would make sense for some 'like' them. This is important, often requirements are written for someone not like 'me' - customers, employees, etc Its why we have personnas. But in the case of creating business forms, the best people to work with are the people who are likely to use that form. It means that user feedback is high quality and less painful to complete.

## Working in Government

We have worked across multiple offices of the state within the UK government

* Delivering a document management solution to maintain clear lines of communication between departments and with the wider electorate.
* Migrating 10s of TBs of documentation, and with it the supporting taxonomy and information site architecture
* Creating an easy to use and up to date whole government department Org Chart - this was NOT just about the tech, this was mostly about getting stakeholders, ie everyone to play their part.
* Building apps for expenses, tracking constituency engagement
* Making multiple departments find their own way in the transition to new, and evolving ways of working - the challenge is to make the tempo of change from office 365 make sense for organizations that like to 'take their time'
