We are Bravo Criteria a self-organizing consultancy that pulls together a group of diverse but like-minded people that are passionate about problem-solving in organizations, who work with the goal of bringing that same attitude to the whole organization.

## The Out of the Box Paradox

Things people say

* "Don't create when you can borrow",
* "Don't overthink it', 
* "Don't over-engineer"

All are ways to say the same thing, but we also 

* Think our problems are unique 
* We have our ways of working
* We kind of believe that computers can do anything.

So you have a paradox, and possibly more than one. That's what following a mentoring / training -  approach can give you. Here at Bravo Criteria we believe that if we let you see what's possible, you'll discover your way of solving problems, that's makes sense with those tools.

## Our Interests and values

* We relish large engaging meetings (both remote and in-person) and we use liberating structures to do this
* Adoption and engagement are central to our practice - we want to help our clients do amazing things.
* We use a systemic approach that asks why problems are problems, before jumping and busily 'solving' them.
* We believe like TRIZ that there aren't 'unique' problems, there are families of problems to which there are already solutions.
* We value curiosity when talking and listening and checking in with people, sometimes using - Clean Language because chances are - if we assume - we'll make an ass out of you and me.
* We're all about 'cleaning up the inputs'
* We have found that an agile approach that leads with documentation and demonstration works best with clients of all sizes.
