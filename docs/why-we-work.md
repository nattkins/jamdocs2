## Our Mission

We want to spend time on the stuff that matters - because there isn't enough to now use it wisely. We're here to help use technology, both the computer kind, the people kind and the thinking kind to help you focus your time on getting meaningful stuff happening

### So that means working remotely right?

Absolutely, though it's not like there is a choice, doing remote meetings like they are in-person used to do will not save your time, in fact they will take longer. 

### What are people technology?

There isn't just one way but the two we like, because they are most energizing and productive and of course make best use of time are clean language and liberating structures. 

## Our Interests and values

* We relish large engaging meetings (both remote and in-person) and we use liberating structures to do this
* Adoption and engagement are central to our practice - we want to help our clients do amazing things.
* We use a systemic approach that asks why problems are problems, before jumping and busily 'solving' them.
* We believe like TRIZ that there aren't 'unique' problems, there are families of problems to which there are already solutions.
* We value curiosity when talking and listening and checking in with people, sometimes using - Clean Language because chances are - if we assume - we'll make an ass out of you and me.
* We're all about 'cleaning up the inputs'
* We have found that an agile approach that leads with documentation and demonstration works best with clients of all sizes.
