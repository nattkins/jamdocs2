## Our Mission

We want to spend time on the stuff that matters - because there isn't enough to now use it wisely. We're here to help use technology, both the computer kind, the people kind and the thinking kind to help you focus your time on getting meaningful stuff happening

### So that means working remotely right?

Absolutely, but if you try to remote working just like in-person you'll know it just doesn't work like that, to improve on the limitations of remote meetings and to make them a more valuable way to work we deploy a number of people technologies.

### What are people technologies?

These are technologies for working well with others, now more than ever we need these means: we find that agile-based project work that makes use of [clean questions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVvcU5gG4KU "Clean Questions and metaphors") and used [liberating structures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxN-98p0CmY "liberating structures") for meetings whether remote or not just makes everything more fulfilling for everyone.

## Our Interests and values

* We relish large engaging meetings (both remote and in-person) and we use liberating structures to do this
* Adoption and engagement are central to our practice - we want to help our clients do amazing things.
* We use a systemic approach that asks why problems are problems, before jumping and busily 'solving' them.
* We believe like TRIZ that there aren't 'unique' problems, there are families of problems to which there are already solutions.
* We value curiosity when talking and listening and checking in with people, sometimes using - Clean Language because chances are - if we assume - we'll make an ass out of you and me.
* We're all about 'cleaning up the inputs'
* We have found that an agile approach that leads with documentation and demonstration works best with clients of all sizes.
