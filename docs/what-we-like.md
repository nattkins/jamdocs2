## We're all about

\- The Office 365 PowerPlatform - Automate, Power Apps and PowerBI are central to much of the work we've been using for the last few years

\- SharePoint - we've been doing SharePoint in its various guises for 13 years

\- Teams - It started out as chat but now it's a great home from home for team working, and so it's our home too. Current events have certainly made this _the_ most important tool.

\- PowerShell - Not everyone knows but in Microsoft land its unsurpassed in its usefulness.

\- Delve - I know right, but the org chart has proved to be amazingly useful

\- And the whole of Azure, too many different things to mention here.

\- Security - because internet!
