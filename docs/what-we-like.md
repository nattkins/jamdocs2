## Our Skills Matrix

These are the skills we bring - and how you might find them useful.

* **Business Analysis** - Being realistic about requirements
* **(IA) Information Architecture**  - Naming is political, calling things by their right name IS half the problem
* **(UI) User Interface** - What boxes, what font, what layout will put the user at the heart of the experience
* **(UX) User eXperience design** - And what sort of experience is that - for example is the experience one of dependency and addiction or empowered and in control
* **Taxonomy Design** - Words live in families what are the word families in a project
* **Training and Adoption** - People like to know how to get the best out of the tools they work with everyday, especially if they are likely to change
* **Governance** - What should we be doing so that if we do it a lot good - ings happen, as opposed to the opposite
* **Project Management** -  Gant charts, planning it has its place and time
* **Scrum Master**  - What are we working on today and what is likely to get in the way, and ideally clear it out of the way.
* **Product Owner** - The person who should be able to answer the question 'why are we building this?' or 'why aren't we building this other thing?'
* **Mentoring** - Its complicated world and everyone needs someone to ask 'how does this work', 'how do I get this done?'
* **Symbolic Modelling** - Poeple have mental metaphorical models, this is the science of making those models tangible
* **Clean Language** - The best questions to ask to reveal mental models

## What we build with

* **The Office 365 Power Platform** - Automate, Power Apps and PowerBI are central to much of the work we've been using for the last few years


* **SharePoint** - we've been doing SharePoint in its various guises for 13 years
* **Teams** - It started out as chat but now it's a great home from home for team working, and so it's our home too. Current events have certainly made this _the_ most important tool.
* **PowerShell** - Not everyone knows but in Microsoft land its unsurpassed in its usefulness.
* **Delve** - I know right, but the org chart has proved to be amazingly useful
* And the whole of Azure, too many different things to mention here.
* **Security** - because internet!

## The tools that help delivery

* **Jira** - A great way to keep everyone on the same page (yes we do know about the To-Do app but sometimes you need the best tool for a job)
* **Confluence** - Its where we like to put our documents - NOT SharePoint, I know right, well that might change in due course, but for now it is the answer for enterprise-grade documentation.
* **Github** - It's part of Microsoft now, so it's not so strange.
* **Markdown and Graphviz** - maybe you'll love them as much as we do someday.
* **Reveal.JS** - because we don't like PowerPoint
* **Zoom** -  I know I know, shouldn't we be using Teams for this - well yes, but Teams doesn't yet have break out rooms, and oh my that makes all the difference.
* **Forestry and Gridsome** - this site was built with it, and for creating websites this combo can't be beat.
