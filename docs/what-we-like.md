## We're all about

* The Office 365 PowerPlatform - Automate, Power Apps and PowerBI are central to much of the work we've been using for the last few years
* SharePoint - we've been doing SharePoint in its various guises for 13 years
* Teams - It started out as chat but now it's a great home from home for team working, and so it's our home too. Current events have certainly made this _the_ most important tool.
* PowerShell - Not everyone knows but in Microsoft land its unsurpassed in its usefulness.
* Delve - I know right, but the org chart has proved to be amazingly useful
* And the whole of Azure, too many different things to mention here.
* Security - because internet!

## The tools that make whole thing sing

* Jira - A great way to keep everyone on the same page (yes we do know about the To-Do app but sometimes you need the best tool for a job)
* Confluence - Its where we like to put our documents - NOT SharePoint, I know right, well that might change in due course, but for now it is the answer for enterprise-grade documentation.
* Github - It's part of Microsoft now, so it's not so strange, and as we've
* Markdown and Graphviz - maybe you'll love them as much as we do someday.
* Reveal.JS - because we don't like PowerPoint
* Forestry and Gridsome - this site was built with it, and for creating website this combo can't be beat.
