## What exactly is a migration?

Migration might be any of these things:

1. A chance to ditch the old tech
2. A Mandate from 'on-high'
3. A corporate rebranding exercise
4. A cover for corporate reorganization
5. Part of a governmental reprioritization
6. An excuse
7. A chance to forget past mistakes/past trauma (you know that old project that went very very wrong, we don't know much but we're not doing _that_ again!
8. A do-over

It's clear to us that migration mainly goes wrong when the goals are vague or numerous - it would be a funny sort of game where you couldn't see the goals and there were lots of them! Maybe this point will seem obvious, because if you don't have a goal then by definition you can't win! But too often the planning is too much like a spy novel, with multiple stakeholders with multiple interests all in competition.

It is as a great woman once said: "like asking X to tell Y to get Z to change!"

The other way to go wrong with migrations is to make any of these assumptions:

* Users won't change their way of working because 'people hate change'
* Users won't need teaching as the tools are all so user-friendly.
* User will have to change as we're taking away the tools that they are used to.
* The platform we're using is very flexible, we can code our way out of any difficulties.
* Users will teach themselves, there is a whole internet out there of useful information

You can probably add your own here, so that's exactly what we do, our plan is quite simple

 1. Get a vision, it will be a metaphor for what you want to happen.
 2. Get widespread agreement of what will be seen and be heard differently if this vision is realized. 
 3. Choose technology and people that are aligned in delivering this vision.
